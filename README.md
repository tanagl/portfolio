# My Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Here are some of the projects I've worked on:


## Machine Learning Framework
- Overview: Machine learning framework package from scratch, to train and predict with a neural network. Suitable for multiclass classification tasks as well as regression problems and binary classification tasks. Includes different activation functions, optimizers as well as feature scaling with a standard scaler. Allows to save trained models and parameters for later initialization from trained parameters.
- Technologies: Python
