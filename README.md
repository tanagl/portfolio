# My Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

## Automated Negotiation Training in VR
![Project Teaserimage](./images/exp01-crop.png)
- Overview: This VR application features a GPT-controlled conversation partner for autonomous negotiation training and was developed for a master thesis study. The study explores the agency effect through framing of the negotiation agent as human-controlled or AI-controlled.
- Technical Details: The negotiation partner was connected to the GPT-4 model from OpenAI to generate responses, through the OkGoDoIt library. Speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality is implemented with Microsoft Azure. Character models were created with Autodesk Character Generator. Animations are from Mixamo and lip-sync is realized with the SALSA LipSync Suite from CrazyMinnowStudio. Developed for the Meta Quest Pro.

## Negotiation Training in VR with Remote-Controlled Virtual Agent

- Overview: This virtual reality application allows negotiation training with a wizard-of-oz controlled agent as negotiation partner. The application can be used as supervisor (to control agent through 2D desktop interface) and trainee (to train with agent as partner in VR or on PC), with each being at different locations.
- Technical Details: Utilized Photon PUN 2 for multiuser functionality (no longer supported) and Amazon Polly for speech file generation. Developed for Meta Quest 2 as standalone application (apk) and as 2D desktop application.

## Machine Learning Framework
- Overview: Machine learning framework package from scratch, to train and predict with a neural network. Suitable for multiclass classification tasks as well as regression problems and binary classification tasks. Includes different activation functions, optimizers as well as feature scaling with a standard scaler. Allows to save trained models and parameters for later initialization from trained parameters.
- Technologies: Python
